NIVA assignment of tidal data

Introduction:
A file is provided with depth measurements, which are not
adjusted to the chart datum (Norwegian "sj√∏kartnull"). Major
task was to adjust the depth in accordance with chart datum.
In addition, file handling in Excel and SQLite.

Major Python libraries used:
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: Pandas, urllib, lxml, sqlalchemy, folium

Challenging aspects of the tasks:
I faced only one major challenge, which is time the constraint.
I do not also have experience and knowledge of tidal information,
depth measurement, chart datum etc. These might cause mistakes in 
my understanding of API use and data readings.

Otherwise, it was exciting to use Python libraries to read the data and
work through it.
