NIVA assignment of tidal data

Introduction:
A file is provided with depth measurements, which are not
adjusted to the chart datum (Norwegian "sj√∏kartnull").

Challenging aspects of the tasks:
I faced only one major challenge, which is time constraint.
I do not also have experience and knowledge of tidal information,
depth measurement, chart datum etc. These might cause mistake in my understanding 
of API use and data readings.

Otherwise, it was exciting to Python libraries to read the data and
work through it.
